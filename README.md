## Research the relative importance of 2pt and 3pt in NBA from 2014 to 2018
_I am a fun of NBA from the era of Michael Jordan. I always have a doubt on the 3pt populatrity as winning factors in the recent years. I therefore compare the 2pt and 3pt shooting percentages and shooting attempts between wining and losing games and between regular and playoff_  

**However, I am surprised with the results I've got to! I try to keep an objective view. Have a look yourself and let me know your thoughts and any suggestions!**
